# Project Duct Tape
This project is my active compilation of state-level abortion information over the past four decades. At completion, it will include a variety of variables, including demographic variables, legislative variables, and information about pro- and anti- abortion non-profits in each state.

This is an independent project and is not affiliated with any organization, company, or group.

#### Project Status: Active

### Sources

Please see the Data Blueprint file for detailed information about the sources for each variable

### Technical Information

This data is currently being compiled in a Python Pandas dataframe. I am making what I currently have publically available as a .CSV file.

I also include the source code I use to clean and compile this dataframe. I do not include the original datasets that the data come from, however, the Data Blueprint links to these sources.

### Important Note

This project is practice for me at using Python for data purposes. I have been trained using statistical software to carry out data analysis and visualization, and now I'm expanding my skills to a more general-purpose language. As such, please excuse any errors or coding faux pas. I do not have a background in computer science.

#### Why 'Project Duct Tape'

Cause I'm smashing this data together with duct tape.
